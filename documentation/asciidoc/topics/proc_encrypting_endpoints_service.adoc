= Generating Service Certificates for Encryption
The {ispn_operator} can generate {openshift} service certificates that:

* Consist of a certificate, `tls.crt`, and key, `tls.key`, in PEM format that
{openshiftshort} creates and stores in a secret.
* Are signed by the {openshiftshort} CA, are valid for one year, and are
automatically replaced before expiration.

If the {ispn_operator} detects that a serving certificates service is available then it will
automatically ask the certificates to the platform and enable TLS. In this case the certificates
will be stored in a secret named `<clusterName>-cert-secret`

.Procedure

. If automatic dectect is not available user can define custom resources to use service certificates for encryption.

<1> encrypts traffic to and from {brandname} endpoints.
<2> configures {brandname} to service certificates.
<3> adds the {openshiftshort} annotation.
<4> names the encryption secret.

. Apply the custom resource with `{oc_apply_cr}`.
. Use `{oc_get_pods_w}` to watch the {ispn_operator} apply the custom resources.
. Retrieve `tls.crt` from the secret to create truststores for clients.
